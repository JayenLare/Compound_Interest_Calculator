# Compound Interest Calculator
**Discover how your money can grow with this compound interest calculator.**

## Description
This program is written in Python and allows the user to enter an initial investment, an amount and frequency that will be contributed to the investment, an amount of years the investment will be held for, the expected compound interest rate, a variance for that interest rate, and how often the investment will compound.
